 - Added `mapnik.register_datasource` to register a single datasource plugin.

 - Added more constants for available `comp-op` values

## 1.2.0

 - Map.render (when rendering to a VectorTile) and VectorTile.render now expect `buffer_size` option to be passed and ignores map.BufferSize (#175)
 - Removed `devDependencies` so that `mocha` and `sphericalmecator` need to be manually installed to run tests
 - Tweaked gyp `Release` configuration to ensure binaries are stripped and built with highest level of optimization

## 1.1.3

 - Gyp binding cleanups
 - Removed direct icu::UnicodString usage to ensure robust compiles against icu build with `-DUSING_ICU_NAMESPACE=0`

 - Disabled default debug symbol generation to speed up builds

## 1.1.2

 - Upgraded to mapnik-vector-tile 3.0.x API

## 1.1.1

 - Fixed extent of vector::tile_datasource to be sensitive to map buffer (TODO - long term
   plan is to make extent optional instead of adding support for layer specific buffered extent) - this is needed for avoiding too restrictive filtering of features at render time.

 - Fixed missing exception translation for MemoryDatasource and Image constructors
 - Fixed invalid default for `scale` in `map.render`
 - Implemented mapnik.Image.fromBytes (#147)

## 1.0.0
 - Dropped support for Mapnik versions older than v2.2.0
 - Moved build system to node-gyp - now supports node v0.10.x
 - Fonts are not longer auto-registered. Call `mapnik.register_default_fonts()` to register "DejaVu" set
   that is often bundled by Mapnik and call `mapnik.register_system_fonts()` to register fonts are various
   known system paths.
 - New mapnik.VectorTile API
